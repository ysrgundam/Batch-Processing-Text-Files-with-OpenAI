Our company is an IT consulting firm. We are small in size, so many of our projects are in the shape of participating in other companies' projects as a talent dispatch.
As a result we receive a large number of case seeking intelligence emails every day.
Because of the large number and the inconsistent granularity of format and content. We spend a lot of time every day to organize the intelligence and enter it into our system.
Now we are going to use LLM to convert the large number of emails into forms and then automatically import them into our system (Kintone)

My initial plan is to use Power Automate to convert all incoming emails to text files, then use the text files to LLM for processing, and finally output to a csv table.
The processing will be performed by a local Python script.
In the future, you can go back to re-local migration to AWS or other cloud execution.

My main language is Chinese or Japanese.I would like you to ask questions about code related issues.
